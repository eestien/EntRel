       "'  A predictive model of terrorist activity is developed by examining the daily\\nnumber of terrorist attacks in Indonesia from 1994 through 2007. The dynamic\\nmodel employs a shot noise process to explain the self-exciting nature of the\\nterrorist activities. This estimates the probability of future attacks as a\\nfunction of the times since the past attacks. In addition, the excess of\\nnonattack days coupled with the presence of multiple coordinated attacks on the\\nsame day compelled the use of hurdle models to jointly model the probability of\\nan attack day and corresponding number of attacks. A power law distribution\\nwith a shot noise driven parameter best modeled the number of attacks on an\\nattack day. Interpretation of the model parameters is discussed and predictive\\nperformance of the models is evaluated.\\n'"

It is shown that the behavior of the mobility coefficients of water molecules and ions, as well as the self diffusion coefficients of water molecules, are determined by the radii of their hard shells rather than by the effect of the hydrogen bond network. It is established that the influence of hydration effects on the density of the system and the self diffusion coefficients of water molecules does not exceed several per cent. Based on microscopic concepts, it is shown that the different behaviors of a $ rm K^{ }$ cation and an $ rm F^{ }$ anion with equal rigid radii are in good agreement with specific features of the intermolecular interaction described by the generalized Stillinger David potential.->(68, 59)',\n",

       " (\"Speciation is the elephant in the room of community ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension. Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and parapatric speciation in networks of communities and focus on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal is low and the number of communities is small. Also, we use several measures of centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity.

       " (\"Speciation is the elephant in the room of community ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension. Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and parapatric speciation in networks of communities and focus on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal is low and the number of communities is small. Also, we use several measures of centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity. The degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is found to be the best predictor of local richness and speciation, although it loses some of its predictive power as connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple neutral model can be combined with network theory to reveal complex relationships between speciation, richness, and the spatial organization of populations.->(50, 54)\",\n",

The latter open up the possibility of building inflationary models that, among other things, do not need ad hoc potentials. Further generalizations have finally led to the most general tensor scalar theory, recently dubbed the Fab Four, with only first and second order derivatives of the fields in the equations of motion and that self tune to a vanishing cosmological constant. This model has a very rich phenomenology that needs to be explored and confronted with experimental data in order to constrain a very large parameter space. In this paper, we present some results regarding a subset of the theory named John, which corresponds to a non minimal derivative coupling between the scalar field and the Einstein tensor in the action. We show that this coupling gives rise to an inflationary model with very unnatural initial conditions. Thus, we include a non minimal, but non derivative, coupling between scalar field and Ricci scalar, a term named George in the Fab Four terminology.

       " (\"Measuring the primordial power spectrum on small scales is a powerful tool in inflation model building, yet constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background measurements alone are insufficient to place bounds stringent enough to be appreciably effective. For the very small scale spectrum, those which subtend angles of less than 0.3 degrees on the sky, an upper bound can be extracted from the astrophysical constraints on the possible production of primordial black holes in the early universe. A recently discovered observational by product of an enhanced power spectrum on small scales, induced gravitational waves, have been shown to be within the range of proposed space based gravitational wave detectors such as NASA's LISA and BBO detectors, and the Japanese DECIGO detector. In this paper we explore the impact such a detection would have on models of inflation known to lead to an enhanced power spectrum on small scales, namely the Hilltop type and running mass models. We find that the Hilltop type model can produce observable induced gravitational waves within the range of BBO and DECIGO for integral and fractional powers of the potential within a reasonable number of e folds. We also find that the running mass model can produce a spectrum within the range of these detectors, but require that inflation terminates after an unreasonably small number of e folds. Finally, we argue that if the thermal history of the Universe were to accomodate such a small number of e folds the Running Mass Model can produce Primordial Black Holes within a mass range compatible with Dark Matter, i.e. within a mass range 10^{20}g< M_{BH}<10^{27}g.->(272, 246)\",\n",

The overall network for the 11 year period 1999 2009 studied was small world and scale free with regard to the in strength. Upon visualizing the network topology an overall structure of the various science fields could be inferred, especially their interconnections.

This generalizes the situation in maximal supergravity, where the E n symmetry algebra can be extended to either a Borcherds superalgebra or to the Kac Moody algebra E 11, and both extensions can be used to derive the spectrum of p form potentials in the theory.

The reason behind this is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area estimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of models to link these areas.

These frameworks provide foundations for formal specification of systems and programming languages, supporting tool development and reasoning. The objective of this one day workshop is to put together theoreticians and practitioners to promote new techniques and results, from the theoretical side, and feedback on the implementation and the use of such techniques and results, from the practical side.->(59, 47)',\n",

The integration of various characteristics is a way to develop hybrid systems to overcome the limitations of individual strategies of each method. In this paper a novel detection module combining the use of adaptive threshold and fuzzy logic reasoning inspired by the Evsukoff's approach is proposed in order to reduce the rate of false alarms, guarantee more robustness to disturbances and assist the operator in making decisions. The proposed approach can be used in case of multiple faults detection. This approach is applied to a benchmark in diagnosis domain the three tank system. The results of the proposed detection module are then presented through a gradual palette of colors in the graphical interface of the system.->(140, 145)\",\n",

For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control function for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven Mach number M_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from one field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and electric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear case, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical situation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind flowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The corresponding current and vortex sheets show in some cases also an alignment, but not in every case. For special density distributions in 2D it is possible to have current but no vortex sheets. In 2D vortex sheets of field aligned flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of small Alfven Mach numbers into account. The current sheet can vanish if the Alfven Mach number is almost constant and the density gradient is large across some boundary layer.

In the frequency domain, we study the dynamic electrophoretic mobility of the particles and the dielectric response of the suspension. We find that the Maxwell Wagner O'Konski process associated with the counterions condensation layer, is enhanced for moderate to high particle charges, yielding an increment of the mobility for such frequencies.

We conjecture that any arbitrary Abelian p form gauge theory would respect the above cited additional symmetry in D 2p p 1, 2, 3. dimensions of spacetime. By exploiting the above inputs, we establish that the Abelian 3 form gauge theory, in six 5 1 dimensions of spacetime, is a perfect model for the Hodge theory whose discrete and continuous symmetry transformations provide the physical realizations of all aspects of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. As far as the physical utility of the above nilpotent symmetries is concerned, we demonstrate that the 2D Abelian 1 form gauge theory is a perfect model of a new class of topological theory and 4D Abelian 2 form as well as 6D Abelian 3 form gauge theories are the field theoretic models for the quasi topological field theory.->(294, 269)',\n",

Existence of superposition in an effective time domain facilitates prediction of long and very short time rheological behavior. Analysis of the observed behavior from effective time approach suggests that superposition is possible only when the shape of a relaxation time spectrum is preserved at various aging times and stresses. We also observe that creep curves at low aging times and greater stresses demonstrate delayed but sudden yielding. The critical time, at which material yields, increases with increase in aging time and decrease in stress.

In this paper we study the properties of the $ gamma$ ray emission from annihilation of WIMP dark matter in the halo of our own Milky Way Galaxy with high resolution $N$ body simulations of a Milky Way like dark matter halo, assuming different nature of WIMPs. Due to the large free streaming length in the scenario of warm WIMPs, the substructure contend of the dark matter halo is significantly different from that of the cold WIMP counterpart, resulting in distinct predictions of the $ gamma$ ray signals from the dark matter annihilation. We illustrate these by comparing the predicted $ gamma$ ray signals from the warm WIMP annihilation to that of cold WIMPs. Pronounced differences from the subhalo skymap and statistical properties between two WIMP models are demonstrated. Due to the potentially enhanced cross section of the non thermal production mechanism in warm WIMP scenario, the Galactic center might be prior for the indirect detection of warm WIMPs to dwarf galaxies, which might be different from the cold dark matter scenario.

An exchange of loops, which we call a double Yang Baxter move, gives the Seiberg duality of the gauge theory, and the invariance of the index under the duality is translated into the Yang Baxter type equation of a spin system defined on a Z invariant lattice on T^2. When we compactify the gauge theory to 3d, Higgs the theory and then compactify further to 2d, the superconformal index reduces to an integral of quantum classical dilogarithm functions. The saddle point of this integral unexpectedly reproduces the hyperbolic volume of a hyperbolic 3 manifold. The 3 manifold is obtained by gluing hyperbolic ideal polyhedra in H^3, each of which could be thought of as a 3d lift of the faces of the 2d bipartite graph.The same quantity is also related with the thermodynamic limit of the BPS partition function, or equivalently the genus 0 topological string partition function, on a toric Calabi Yau manifold dual to quiver gauge theories.

The proposal is valid for large spin chains and is based on the construction of the monodromy matrix using the Dunkl operators. For the Inozemtsev model these operators are known explicitly. This construction gives in particular the eigenvectors of an operator closely related to the dilatation operator of the N 4 gauge theory in the su 2 sector up to three loop order, as well as their scalar products.

The need for effective control is exemplified during the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS in 2003, which has inflicted near to a thousand deaths as well as bankruptcies of airlines and related businesses. In this article, we examine the efficacy of control strategies on the propagation of infectious diseases based on removing connections within real world airline network with the associated economic and social costs taken into account through defining appropriate quantitative measures. We uncover the surprising results that removing less busy connections can be far more effective in hindering the spread of the disease than removing the more popular connections. Since disconnecting the less popular routes tend to incur less socio economic cost, our finding suggests the possibility of trading minimal reduction in connectivity of an important hub with efficiencies in epidemic control. In particular, we demonstrate the performance of various local epidemic control strategies, and show how our approach can predict their cost effectiveness through the spreading control characteristics.->(88, 19)',\n",

Here we report a very fast single photon source in the 1,550 nm telecom band, which is achieved by a large Purcell enhancement that results from the coupling of a single InAs quantum dot and an InP photonic crystal nanocavity. At a resonance, the spontaneous emission rate was enhanced by a factor of 5 resulting a record fast emission lifetime of 0.2 ns at 1,550 nm. We also demonstrate that this emission exhibits an enhanced anti bunching dip. This is the first realization of nanocavity enhanced single photon emitters in the 1,550 nm telecom band. This coupled quantum dot cavity system in the telecom band thus provides a bright high bit rate non classical single photon source that offers appealing novel opportunities for the development of a long haul quantum telecommunication system via optical fibres.->(131, 167)',\n",

Then, we show that the model exhibits exact cosmological solution which yields a transition from matter domination into dark energy and compare it with the $ Lambda$CDM behavior. Especially, we calculate the age of the Universe and show that it is consistent with the observational value if the equation of the state $ omega_f$ for the cosmological fluid is within the range of $0.13 < omega_f < 0.22.$ Some implication of this result is also discussed.->(11, 110)',\n",

We consider layered earth inversion to interpret large data sets of hundreds of kilometre. Different strategies can be used to solve this inverse problem. This consists in managing the a priori information to avoid the mathematical instability and provide the most plausible model of conductivity in depth. In order to obtain fast and realistic inversion program, we tested three kinds of regularization two are based on standard Tikhonov procedure which consist in minimizing not only the data misfit function but a balanced optimization function with additional terms constraining the lateral and the vertical smoothness of the conductivity another kind of regularization is based on reducing the condition number of the kernel by changing the layout of layers before minimizing the data misfit function. Finally, in order to get a more realistic distribution of conductivity, notably by removing negative conductivity values, we suggest an additional recursive filter based upon the inversion of the logarithm of the conductivity. All these methods are tested on synthetic and real data sets. Synthetic data have been calculated by 2.5D modelling they are used to demonstrate that these methods provide equivalent quality in terms of data misfit and accuracy of the resulting image the limit essentially comes on special targets with sharp 2D geometries. The real data case is from Helicopter borne TEM data acquired in the basin of Franceville Gabon where borehole conductivity loggings are used to show the good accuracy of the inverted models in most areas, and some biased depths in areas where strong lateral changes may occur.->(236, 203)',\n",

Chiral Effective Field Theory ChiEFT describes nucleon, deuteron and 3 He Compton scattering, using consistent nuclear currents, rescattering and wave functions. It can thus also be used to extract useful information on the neutron amplitude from Compton scattering on light nuclei. We summarise past work in ChiEFT on all of these reactions and compare with other theoretical approaches. We also discuss all proton experiments up to about 400 MeV, as well as the three modern elastic deuteron data sets, paying particular attention to precision and accuracy of each set. Constraining the Delta 1232 parameters from the resonance region, we then perform new fits to the proton data up to omega lab 170 MeV, and a new fit to the deuteron data. After checking in each case that a two parameter fit is compatible with the respective Baldin sum rules, we obtain, using the sum rule constraints in a one parameter fit, alpha 10.7 pm0.3 stat pm0.2 Baldin pm0.8 theory, beta 3.1 mp0.3 stat pm0.2 Baldin pm0.8 theory, for the proton polarisabilities, and alpha 10.9 pm 0.9 stat pm0.2 Baldin pm0.8 theory, beta 3.6 mp 0.9 stat pm0.2 Baldin pm0.8 theory, for the isoscalar polarisabilities, each in units of 10^ 4 fm^3.

In particularly, the role of conservation laws, the values of hard core radii along with the effects of the Lorentz contraction of hadron eigen volumes and the hadronic surface tension are systematically studied. It is shown that for the adequate description of hadron multiplicities the conservation laws should be modified, whereas for the description of hadron yield ratios the conservation laws are not necessary at all. Also here we analyzed the usual criteria for the chemical freeze out and found that none of them is robust. A new chemical freeze out criterion of constant entropy per hadron equals to 7.18 is suggested and a novel effect of adiabatic chemical hadron production is discussed. Additionally, we found that the data for the center of mass energies above 10 GeV lead to the temperature of the nil hadronic surface tension coefficient of about $T_0 147 pm 7$ MeV. This is a very intriguing result since a very close estimate for such a temperature was obtained recently within entirely different approach. We argue that these two independently obtained results evidence that the tri critical temperature of the QCD phase diagram is between 140 and 154 MeV. In addition, here we suggest to consider the pion and kaon hard core radii as new fitting parameters.

The first is essentially historical ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th century and early 20th, when it was found that only the lowest order harmonics are expressible in closed form. Each higher order term requires the solution of an eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged applications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical even with modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in ellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those in Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the barrier to entry by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin using ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research.

This potential is an extension in the 3D space of a 2D potential based on a family of figure eight orbits, which was produced using the theory of the inverse problem. Starting from the results obtained from the 2D system, we proceed to locate the regions in the phase space of the 3D potential, producing regular or chaotic orbits. In order to obtain this we use a new dynamical parameter, the S c spectrum, which proves to be a useful and fast indicator in order to distinguish regular motion from chaos in 3D potentials.

The primary scintillation yield of the fast emission component in gaseous Ar was found to be independent of temperature in the range of 87 160 K it amounted to 17000 3000 photon MeV in the NIR in the range of 690 1000 nm. In liquid Ar at 87 K, the primary scintillation yield of the fast component was considerably reduced, amounting to 510 90 photon MeV, in the range of 400 1000 nm. Proportional NIR scintillations electroluminescence in gaseous Ar were also observed their amplification parameter at 160 K was measured to be 13 photons per drifting electron per kV. No proportional scintillations were observed in liquid Ar up to the electric fields of 30 kV cm. The applications of NIR scintillations in dark matter search and coherent neutrino nucleus scattering experiments and in ion beam radiotherapy are considered.->(25, 23)',\n",

In particular, we compute the family of kinematic formulas for invariant valuations and invariant curvature measures in these spaces. In addition to new and more efficient framings of the tube formulas of Gray and the kinematic formulas of Shifrin, this approach yields a new formula expressing the volumes of the tubes about a totally real submanifold in terms of its intrinsic Riemannian structure. We also show by direct calculation that the Lipschitz Killing valuations stabilize the subspace of invariant angular curvature measures, suggesting the possibility that a similar phenomenon holds for all Riemannian manifolds.

We study the stationary solutions of a structured population model, while the population is structured by continuous phenotypical traits and discrete positions in space. The growth term varies from one habitable zone to another, for instance because of a change in the temperature. The individuals can migrate from one zone to another with a constant rate.

In the first sum rule, we consider the possibility that the intermediate state in the scattering can have spin j pm 1 and the same mass as the target. The second sum rule applies if the theory at hand possesses intermediate narrow resonances with masses different from the mass of the scatterer. These sum rules are generalizations of the Gerasimov Drell Hearn Weinberg sum rule. Along with the requirement of tree level unitarity, they relate different low energy couplings in the theory. Using these sum rules, we show that in certain cases the gyromagnetic ratio can differ from the natural value g 2, even at tree level, without spoiling perturbative unitarity. These sum rules can be used as constraints applicable to all supergravity and higher spin theories that contain particles charged under some U 1 gauge field. In particular, applied to four dimensional N 8 supergravity in a spontaneously broken phase, these sum rules suggest that for the theory to have a good ultraviolet behavior, additional massive states need to be present, such as those coming from the embedding of the N 8 supergravity in type II superstring theory.

In this paper we analyze main international and industrial standards targeting information security and their conformity with cloud computing security challenges.

This agent based model captures the essential features of the agreement dynamics by means of a memory based negotiation process. Our study focuses on the impact of time varying properties of the social network of the agents on the naming game dynamics. In particular, we perform a computational exploration of this model using simulations on top of real networks. We investigate the outcomes of the dynamics on two different types of time varying data i the networks vary on a day to day basis and ii the networks vary within very short intervals of time 20 seconds. In the first case, we find that networks with strong community structure hinder the system from reaching global agreement the evolution of the naming game in these networks maintains clusters of coexisting opinions indefinitely leading to metastability. In the second case, we investigate the evolution of the naming game in perfect synchronization with the time evolution of the underlying social network shedding new light on the traditional emergent properties of the game that differ largely from what has been reported in the existing literature.->(20, 16)',\n",

Many of these embedded processors depend upon custom built Instruction Ser Architecture ISA such as game processor GPU, multimedia processors, DSP processors etc. Primary requirement for consumer electronic industry is low cost with high performance and low power consumption. A lot of research has been evolved to enhance the performance of embedded processors through parallel computing. But some of them focus superscalar processors i.e. single processors with more resources like Instruction Level Parallelism ILP which includes Very Long Instruction Word VLIW architecture, custom instruction set extensible processor architecture and others require more number of processing units on a single chip like Thread Level Parallelism TLP that includes Simultaneous Multithreading SMT, Chip Multithreading CMT and Chip Multiprocessing CMP. In this paper, we present a new technique, named C slow, to enhance performance for embedded processors for consumer electronics by exploiting multithreading technique in single core processors. Without resulting into the complexity of micro controlling with Real Time Operating system RTOS, C slowed processor can execute multiple threads in parallel using single datapath of Instruction Set processing element.

This leads to the disruption of the service and it is necessary to consider a measure to avoid or relieve congestion of cloud computing environments. This paper proposes a new congestion control method for cloud computing environments which reduces the size of required resource for congested resource type instead of restricting all service requests as in the existing networks. Next, this paper proposes the user service specifications for the proposed congestion control method, and clarifies the algorithm to decide the optimal size of required resource to be reduced, based on the load offered to the system. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposed method can handle more requests compared with the conventional methods and relieve the congestion.

It is supposed that both upward and downward bandwidths are allocated simultaneously in the selected LSP pair for each service request. It is demonstrated by simulation evaluations that the proposal method could reduce the total amount of the bandwidth required by up to 15% compared with the conventional selection method.

The upper bounds are universal, and the lower bounds hold for the rich family of sub Gaussian distributions with independent features. We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizes the true sample complexity of large margin classification. To prove the lower bound, we develop several new tools of independent interest. These include new connections between shattering and hardness of learning, new properties of shattering with linear classifiers, and a new lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a random Gram matrix generated by sub Gaussian variables.

The generator of this process with killing, called the elliptic Heston operator, is a second order, degenerate, elliptic partial differential operator whose coefficients have linear growth in the spatial variables and where the degeneracy in the operator symbol is proportional to the distance to the boundary of the half plane.

Those same applications attract widespread criticism by dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information theory interpretations of natural selection, and partitions of causes by path analysis.

Knowing the true distribution is important in many circumstances, in particular to apply efficient maximum likelihood methods, obtain consistent estimates of partial effects and appropriate predictions of the probability of future events. We propose a transformation of data which under the true conditional distribution leads to continuous uniform iid series. The uniformity and serial independence of the new series is then examined simultaneously. The transformation can be considered as an extension of the integral transform tool for noncontinuous data. We derive asymptotic properties of such tests taking into account the parameter estimation effect. Since transformed series are iid we do not require any mixing conditions and asymptotic results illustrate the double simultaneous checking nature of our test. The test statistics converges under the null with a parametric rate to the asymptotic distribution, which is case dependent, hence we justify a parametric bootstrap approximation. The test has power against local alternatives and is consistent. The performance of the new tests is compared with classical specification checks for discrete choice models.->(39, 43)',\n",

As we show, however, such an approach raises serious theoretical challenges. Indeed, we demonstrate that many commonly used surrogate losses for pairwise comparison data do not yield consistency surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low noise settings.

In analogy to all versus nothing proofs of Bell nonlocality, here we present a proof of steering without inequalities rendering the detection of correlations leading to a violation of steering inequalities unnecessary. We show that, given any two qubit entangled state, the existence of certain projective measurement by Alice so that Bob's normalized conditional states can be regarded as two different pure states provides a criterion for Alice to Bob steerability. A steering inequality equivalent to the all versus nothing proof is also obtained. Our result clearly demonstrates that there exist many quantum states which do not violate any previously known steering inequality but are indeed steerable.

Such a suspicion has been supported mainly by a variety of specific examples from string theory. This paper is intended to purport the holographic gravity from a different perspective. Namely we propose that such a holography can actually be observed within the context of Einstein's gravity, where neither is spacetime required to be asymptotically AdS nor the boundary to be located at conformal infinity. We show that our holography works remarkably well at least at the level of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. In particular, a perfect matching between the bulk gravity and boundary system is found not only for the equilibrium variation but also for the non equilibrium entropy production, where a method of conserved current is seen to be efficient in relating the black hole perturbation in the bulk gravity and the non equilibrium thermodynamics on the boundary.->(121, 119)\",\n",

Second, for large and heterogeneous spatial domains, it is often not appropriate to assume that a process of interest is stationary over the entire domain. We address the first challenge by using a model combining a low rank component, which allows for flexible modeling of medium to long range dependence via a set of spatial basis functions, with a tapered remainder component, which allows for modeling of local dependence using a compactly supported covariance function. Addressing the second challenge, we propose two extensions to this model that result in increased flexibility First, the model is parameterized based on a nonstationary Matern covariance, where the parameters vary smoothly across space. Second, in our fully Bayesian model, all components and parameters are considered random, including the number, locations, and shapes of the basis functions used in the low rank component.

Contractivity is a property of some quantum processes where the trace distance of density matrices decrease with time. From this, we show how a witness of initial correlations is an upper bound to a witness of non Markovianity. We discuss how this relationship shows further connections between initial system environment correlations and non Markovianity at an instance of time in open quantum systems.->(9, 13)',\n",

Each monomer occupies a unit cell of four lattice sites. The condition that a lattice site can at best be a part of only one monomer ensures self avoidance and models excluded volume effect. We have simulated polymers with number of monomers ranging from 10 to 50 employing Boltzmann and non Boltzmann Monte Carlo simulation techniques. To detect and characterize phase transition we have investigated heat capacity through energy fluctuations, Landau free energy profiles and Binder's fourth cumulant. We have investigated 1 free standing polymer 2 polymer in the presence of of an attracting wall and 3 polymer confined between two attracting walls. In general we find there are two transitions as we cool the system. The first occurs at relatively higher temperature. The polymer goes from an extended coil to a collapsed globule conformation. This we call collapse transition. We find that this transition is first order. The second occurs at a lower temperature in which the polymer goes from a collapsed phase to a very compact crystalline phase. This transition is also discontinuous. We find that in the presence of wall s the collapse transition occurs at lower temperature compared to a free standing polymer.->(24, 21)\",\n",

The Mathieu group correspondence recently discovered by Eguchi Ooguri Tachikawa is recovered as a special case. We introduce a notion of extremal Jacobi form and prove that it characterises the Jacobi forms arising by establishing a connection to critical values of Dirichlet series attached to modular forms of weight two. These extremal Jacobi forms are closely related to certain vector valued mock modular forms studied recently by Dabholkar Murthy Zagier in connection with the physics of quantum black holes in string theory. In a manner similar to monstrous moonshine the automorphic forms we identify constitute evidence for the existence of infinite dimensional graded modules for the six groups in our system. We formulate an umbral moonshine conjecture that is in direct analogy with the monstrous moonshine conjecture of Conway Norton. Curiously, we find a number of Ramanujan's mock theta functions appearing as McKay Thompson series. A new feature not apparent in the monstrous case is a property which allows us to predict the fields of definition of certain homogeneous submodules for the groups involved. For four of the groups in our system we find analogues of both the classical McKay correspondence and McKay's monstrous Dynkin diagram observation manifesting simultaneously and compatibly.->(210, 22)\",\n",

       " (\"TW Coronae Borealis TW CrB is a binary system likely to be active showing evidence of starspots and a hotspot. We calculated a new ephemeris based on all available timings from 1946 and find the period to be 0.58887492 2 days. We have revised the average rate of change of period down from 1.54 16 x 10 7 days yr 1 to 6.66 14 x10 8 days yr 1. Based on light curve simulation analysis we conclude that the two stars are close to filling their Roche lobes, or possibly that one of the stars' Roche lobe has been filled. The modelling also led to a hotspot and two starspots being identified. Conservative mass transfer is one of a number of possible mechanisms considered that could explain the change in period, but the mass transfer rate would be significantly lower than previous estimates. We found evidence that suggests the period was changing in a cyclical manner, but we do not have sufficient data to make a judgement on the mechanism causing this variation. The existence of a hotspot suggests mass transfer with a corresponding increase in the amplitude in the B band as compared with the R and V bands. The chromospheric activity implied by the starspots make this binary a very likely X ray source.->(16, 213)\",\n",

That is, one cannot a priori determine the minimal path traversed by a billiard ball subject to a collision in the boundary of the table. It is this problem which makes Omega KS such an interesting, yet difficult, table to analyze. In this paper, we approach this problem by approximating from the inside Omega KS by well defined prefractal rational polygonal billiard tables Omega KS_n. We first show that the flat surface S KS_n determined from the rational billiard Omega KS_n is a branched cover of the singly punctured hexagonal torus. Such a result, when combined with the results of Gut2, allows us to define a sequence of compatible orbits of prefractal billiards. We define a hybrid orbit of a prefractal billiard Omega KS_n and show that every dense orbit of a prefractal billiard is a dense hybrid orbit of Omega KS_n. This result is key in obtaining a topological dichotomy for a sequence of compatible orbits. Furthermore, we determine a sufficient condition for a sequence of compatible orbits to be a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We then examine the limiting behavior of a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We show that the trivial limit of particular eventually constant sequences of compatible hybrid orbits constitutes an orbit of Omega KS. In addition, we show that the union of two suitably chosen nontrivial polygonal paths connects two elusive limit points of the Koch snowflake. Finally, we discuss how it may be possible for our results to be generalized to other fractal billiard tables and how understanding the structures of the Veech groups of the prefractal billiards may help in determining fractal flat surfaces' naturally associated with the billiard flows.->(42, 12)\",\n",

It is important to realise that there are significant physical constraints on such integer based proposals when one somewhat speculatively attempts to extend them outside their original extremal and supersymmetric framework. Specifically, in their most natural and direct physical interpretations, some of the more speculative integer based proposals for the quantization of horizon areas fail for the ordinary Kerr Newman black holes in 3 1 dimensions, essentially because the fine structure constant is not an integer. A more baroque interpretation involves asserting the fine structure constant is the square root of a rational number but such a proposal has its own problems. Insofar as one takes 3 1 general relativity plus the usual quantization of angular momentum and electric charge as being paramount, the known explicitly calculable spectra of horizon areas for the physically compelling Kerr Newman spacetimes indicate that some caution is called for when assessing the universality of some of the more speculative integer based string inspired proposals.->(75, 77)',\n",

The second is a quadratic identity which is a representation of the D dimensional quantum Hamilton Jacobi equation. In this approach, the solutions of the associated Schrodinger equation are used to solve the nonlinear quantum Hamilton Jacobi equation. A basic property of the construction is that the two solutions of the corresponding Schrodinger equation must be retained.

We consider two well known combinatorial games, 3 pile Nim and 3 row Chomp. In the case of Nim, we observe that the introduction of the pass dramatically alters the game's underlying structure, rendering it considerably more complex, while for Chomp, the pass move is found to have relatively minimal impact. We show how these results can be understood by recasting these games as dynamical systems describable by dynamical recursion relations. From these recursion relations we are able to identify underlying structural connections between these games with passes and a recently introduced class of generic perturbed games.

The gas of N particles is initially in the ground state within hard wall or harmonic traps, then it expands after dropping the trap. We compute the time dependence of the von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies and the particle fluctuations of spatial intervals around the original trap, in the limit of a large number N of particles. The results for these observables apply to one dimensional gases of impenetrable bosons as well. We identify different dynamical regimes at small and large times, depending also on the initial condition, whether it is that of a hard wall or harmonic trap. In particular, we analytically show that the expansion from hard wall traps is characterized by the asymptotic small time behavior $S approx 1 3 ln 1 t $ of the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the relation $S approx pi^2 V 3$ where V is the particle variance, which are analogous to the equilibrium behaviors whose leading logarithms are essentially determined by the corresponding conformal field theory with central charge $c 1$. The time dependence of the entanglement entropy of extended regions during the expansion from harmonic traps shows the remarkable property that it can be expressed as a global time dependent rescaling of the space dependence of the initial equilibrium entanglement entropy.->(113, 101)',\n",

Thus, the presented method is well suited for tightly focused optical lattices that have sufficient trap depth only close to the focus. Tight focusing is usually required for far detuned optical traps or traps that require high laser intensity for other reasons.

We also show how the resulting expression can be reconstructed from a corresponding quantity in the Euclidean theory, by means of analytic continuation.

The usual cause of this distance change is the reflex motion about the system's barycenter due to the gravitational influence of one or more additional bodies. We analyze 5032 eclipsing contact EC and detached ED binaries from the All Sky Automated Survey ASAS catalogue to detect variations in the times of eclipses which possible can be due to the LTE effect. To this end we use an approach known from the radio pulsar timing where a template radio pulse of a pulsar is used as a reference to measure the times of arrivals of the collected pulses. In our analysis as a template for a photometric time series from ASAS, we use a best fitting trigonometric series representing the light curve of a given EC or ED. Subsequently, an O C diagram is built by comparing the template light curve with light curves obtained from subsets of a given time series. Most of the variations we detected in O Cs correspond to a linear period change. Three show evidence of more than one complete LTE orbit. For these objects we obtained preliminary orbital solutions. Our results demonstrate that the timing analysis employed in radio pulsar timing can be effectively used to study large data sets from photometric surveys.->(67, 63)\",\n",

We show that the shape dependent coefficients that arise are even powers of the extrinsic curvature and its derivatives.

Longitudinal MHD waves in density stratified loops with constant magnetic field are also analyzed. From analytical solutions, the frequency ratio of the first overtone and fundamental mode is investigated in stratified waveguides. For small expansion, a linear dependence between the frequency ratio and the expansion factor is found.

Such a deformation is shown to cause a shift in the condensation temperature $T_{c}$ of the BEC and, for a specific functional form of deformation, this shift can be as large as the current measured precision on $T_{c}$. For a $_{37}^{85}Rb$ cold atom BEC with a particle density $n simeq 10^{12}cm^{ 3}$ we find a fractional shift of order $10^{ 4}$, but this can be much larger for even more dilute BECs. We discuss the possibility of planning specific experiments with BECs that might provide phenomenological constraints on Planck scale physics. These corrections to $T_{c}$ are found to be extremely small for ultrarelativistic BECs implying that, in some cases, Planck scale effects may be more important in low rather than high energy processes.->(23, 128)',\n",

In the crystallized crust of neutron stars the evolution of the magnetic field is governed by the Hall induction equation. In this equation the relative contribution of the two terms Hall term and Ohmic dissipation varies depending on the local conditions of temperature and magnetic field strength. This results in the transition from the purely parabolic character of the equations to the hyperbolic regime as the magnetic Reynolds number increases, which presents severe numerical problems. Up to now, most attempts to study this problem were based on spectral methods, but they failed in representing the transition to large magnetic Reynolds numbers. We present a new code based on upwind finite differences techniques that can handle situations with arbitrary low magnetic diffusivity and it is suitable for studying the formation of sharp current sheets during the evolution. The code is thoroughly tested in different limits and used to illustrate the evolution of the crustal magnetic field in a neutron star in some representative cases. Our code, coupled to cooling codes, can be used to perform long term simulations of the magneto thermal evolution of neutron stars.->(183, 28)',\n",

       " (\"Since globular clusters GCs are old, low N systems their dynamics is widely believed to be fully dominated by collisional two body processes, and their surface brightness profiles are fit by King models. However, for many GCs, especially those with HST resolved central regions, and extra tidal' features, King models provide poor fits. We suggest that this is partly because collisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the cluster properties. We show using time scale and length scale arguments that except for the very centers of clusters, collisionless dynamics should be more important than collisional. We then fit 38 GCs analyzed by Noyola and Gebhardt 2006 with collisional King and collisionless DARKexp models over the full available radial range, and find that the latter provide a better fit to 29 GCs for six of these the fit is at least 5x better in term of rms. DARKexp models are theoretically derived maximum entropy equilibrium states of self gravitating collisionless systems and have already been shown to fit the results of dark matter N body simulations. We do not attempt fits with ad hoc fitting functions. ->(69, 2)\",\n",

We present a Bayesian analysis that directly compares the NS mass distribution observed in double NS systems to theoretical models of NS formation. We find that models with standard binary mass ratio distributions are strongly preferred over independently picking the masses from the initial mass function, although the strength of the inference depends on whether current assumptions for identifying the remnants of the primary and secondary stars are correct. Second, NS formation models with no mass fallback are favored because they reduce the dispersion in NS masses. The double NS system masses thus directly point to the mass coordinate where the supernova explosion was initiated, making them an excellent probe of the supernova explosion mechanism. If we assume no fallback and simply vary the mass coordinate separating the remnant and the supernova ejecta, we find that for solar metallicity stars the explosion most likely develops at the edge of the iron core at a specific entropy of about 2.8 k_B. The primary limitations of our study are the poor knowledge of the supernova explosion mechanism and the lack of broad range of SN model explosions of LMC to solar metallicity.->(6, 107)',\n",

The detailed analysis indicates correlations between model parameters and also indicates an increasing role of shadowing at LHC energies. Within the investigated class of models, a simple and model independent phenomenological relation was discovered that connects the total p p scattering cross section to the effective quark, diquark size and their average separation.

In this work, we built a multi scale model to simulate the dynamics of B cells in the primary and secondary immune responses of zebrafish. We use this model to explain the reported correlation between VDJ usage of B cell repertoires in individual zebrafish. We use a delay ordinary differential equation ODE system to model the immune responses in the 6 month lifespan of a zebrafish. This mean field theory gives the number of high affinity B cells as a function of time during an infection. The sequences of those B cells are then taken from a distribution calculated by a microscopic random energy model. This generalized $NK$ model shows that mature B cells specific to one antigen largely possess a single VDJ recombination. The model allows first principles calculation of the probability, $p$, that two zebrafish responding to the same antigen will select the same VDJ recombination. This probability $p$ increases with the B cell population size and the B cell selection intensity. The probability $p$ decreases with the B cell hypermutation rate. The multi scale model predicts correlations in the immune system of the zebrafish that are highly similar to that from experiment.->(48, 55)',\n",

In such a setting, the presence of a magnetic field induces a bulk fermion condensate which spontaneously breaks CP invariance. We develop the holographic dictionary between composite operators and show that this bulk condensate has the interpretation of boundary magnetic catalysis involving a double trace operator.

The channel is assumed to be a linear time invariant Gaussian channel, where perfect channel knowledge is available at both the transmitter and the receiver. We consider a general class of right invertible time preserving sampling methods which include irregular nonuniform sampling, and characterize in closed form the channel capacity achievable by this class of sampling methods, under a sampling rate and power constraint. Our results indicate that the optimal sampling structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest signal to noise ratio among all spectral sets of measure equal to the sampling rate. This can be attained through filterbank sampling with uniform sampling at each branch with possibly different rates, or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform sampling. These results reveal that for a large class of channels, employing irregular nonuniform sampling sets, while typically complicated to realize, does not provide capacity gain over uniform sampling sets with appropriate preprocessing. Our findings demonstrate that aliasing or scrambling of spectral components does not provide capacity gain, which is in contrast to the benefits obtained from random mixing in spectrum blind compressive sampling schemes.->(99, 110)',\n",

I review several approaches to specifying the neighborhood structure for constructing the MRF precision matrix, presenting results comparing these MRF representations analytically, in simulations, and in two examples. The results provide practical guidance for choosing a spatial process representation and highlight the importance of this choice. In particular, the results demonstrate that, and explain why, standard CAR models can behave strangely for point level data. They show that various neighborhood weighting approaches based on higher order neighbors that have been suggested for MRF models do not produce smooth fields, which raises doubts about their utility. Finally, they indicate that an MRF that approximates a thin plate spline compares favorably to standard CAR models and to kriging under many circumstances.->(105, 16)',\n",

       " (\"Interference alignment IA is a cooperative transmission strategy that, under some conditions, achieves the interference channel's maximum number of degrees of freedom. Realizing IA gains, however, is contingent upon providing transmitters with sufficiently accurate channel knowledge. In this paper, we study the performance of IA in multiple input multiple output systems where channel knowledge is acquired through training and analog feedback. We design the training and feedback system to maximize IA's effective sum rate a non asymptotic performance metric that accounts for estimation error, training and feedback overhead, and channel selectivity. We characterize effective sum rate with overhead in relation to various parameters such as signal to noise ratio, Doppler spread, and feedback channel quality. A main insight from our analysis is that, by properly designing the CSI acquisition process, IA can provide good sum rate performance in a very wide range of fading scenarios. Another observation from our work is that such overhead aware analysis can help solve a number of practical network design problems. To demonstrate the concept of overhead aware network design, we consider the example problem of finding the optimal number of cooperative IA users based on signal power and mobility.->(17, 36)\",\n",

When the graph's nodes stand for the possible solutions to certain problems of combinatorial optimization, choosing its edges appropriately has been shown to lead to conduciveness properties that provide useful insight into the performance of algorithms to solve those problems. Here we study the conduciveness of CA rule graphs, that is, graphs whose node set is the set of all CA rules given a cell's number of possible states and neighborhood size. We consider several different edge sets interconnecting these nodes, both deterministic and random ones, and derive analytical expressions for the resulting graph's conduciveness toward rules having a fixed number of non quiescent entries. We demonstrate that one of the random edge sets, characterized by allowing nodes to be sparsely interconnected across any Hamming distance between the corresponding rules, has the potential of providing reasonable conduciveness toward the desired rules.

He showed that bialgebroids $H$ with base ring $R$ could be characterized in terms of skew monoidal structures on the category of one sided $R$ modules for which the lax unit was $R$ itself. We define skew monoidales or skew pseudo monoids in any monoidal bicategory $ mathscr M$. These are skew monoidal categories when $ mathscr M$ is $ mathrm{Cat}$. Our main results are presented at the level of monoidal bicategories. However, a consequence is that quantum categories in the sense of Day Street with base comonoid $C$ in a suitably complete braided monoidal category $ mathscr V$ are precisely skew monoidales in $ mathrm{Comod} mathscr V $ with unit coming from the counit of $C$. Quantum groupoids are those skew monoidales with invertible associativity constraint. In fact, we provide some very general results connecting opmonoidal monads and skew monoidales. We use a lax version of the concept of warping defined recently by Booker Street to modify monoidal structures.->(9, 69)\",\n",

Then, we investigate the possible consequences of instabilities in empirical correlation coefficient measurements on optimal portfolio selection. We rely on previously published works which provide a framework allowing to take into account possible risk underestimations due to the non optimality of the portfolio weights being used in order to distinguish such non optimality effects from risk underestimations genuinely due to non stationarities. We interpret such results in terms of instabilities in some spectral properties of portfolio correlation matrices.->(131, 68)',\n",

As it is impossible to exactly determine initial conditions for a realistic system, we choose to work in the statistical Ehrenfest formalism that we introduced in Ref. 1. From it, we develop a new framework to determine exactly the change in the purity of the quantum subsystem along the evolution of a statistical Ehrenfest system. In a simple case, we verify how and to which extent Ehrenfest statistical dynamics makes a system with more than one classical trajectory and an initial quantum pure state become a quantum mixed one. We prove this numerically showing how the evolution of purity depends on time, on the dimension of the quantum state space $D$, and on the number of classical trajectories $N$ of the initial distribution. The results in this work open new perspectives for studying decoherence with Ehrenfest dynamics.->(155, 138)',\n",

Theory developed in recent years has coined a paradigm according to which sparsity promoting regularization is regarded as a necessity in such setting. Deviating from this paradigm, we show that non negativity constraints on the regression coefficients may be similarly effective as explicit regularization if the design matrix has additional properties, which are met in several applications of non negative least squares NNLS. We show that for these designs, the performance of NNLS with regard to prediction and estimation is comparable to that of the lasso. We argue further that in specific cases, NNLS may have a better $ ell_{ infty}$ rate in estimation and hence also advantages with respect to support recovery when combined with thresholding. From a practical point of view, NNLS does not depend on a regularization parameter and is hence easier to use.->(119, 117)',\n",

       " ('The recent precise measurement of the mass of pulsar PSR J1614$ $2230, as well as observational indications of even more massive neutron stars, has revived the question of the composition of matter at the high densities prevailing inside neutron star cores. We study the impact on the maximum possible neutron star mass of an exotic core consisting of non nucleonic matter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first order phase transition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of non nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state subject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The case of a hadron quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely nucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that have been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass radius relation of cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations. We find that even if there is a significant softening of the equation of state associated with the actual transition to an exotic phase, there can still be a stiffening at higher densities closer to the center of the star that is sufficient to increase the maximum possible mass. However with quarks the maximum neutron star mass is always reduced by assuming that the sound speed is limited by $c sqrt{3}$ as suggested by QCD calculations. In particular, by invoking such a phase transition, it becomes possible to support PSR J1614$ $2230 with a nucleonic equation of state that is soft enough to be compatible with the kaon and pion production in heavy ion collisions.->(64, 64)',\n",

The uncertainty in the velocity field can arise from the incomplete description of either porosity field, injection flux, or both . The uncertainty in the total velocity field lead to the spatiotemporal uncertainty in the saturation field . Given information about the spatial temporal statistic of the correlated heterogeneity, we leverage method of distribution to derive deterministic equation that govern the evolution of single point CDF of saturation .

Hereby, we give route to circumventing the computational cost of Monte Carlo scheme while obtaining the full statistical description of saturation . We conduct a set of numerical experiment and compare statistic of saturation computed with the method of distributions, against those obtained using the statistical moment equation approach and kernel density estimation post processing of high resolution Monte Carlo simulation . This comparison demonstrates that the CDF equation remain accurate over a wide range of statistical properties, i .e . standard deviation and correlation length of the underlying random fields, while the corresponding low order statistical moment equation significantly deviate from Monte Carlo results, unless for very small value of standard deviation and correlation length .->(13, 7)',\n",

Our simulation show that Zwanzig's expression overestimate $D$ in an uncorrelated Gaussian random lattice differing by almost an order of magnitude at moderately high ruggedness . The disparity originates from the presence of three site trap TST on the landscape which are formed by the presence of deep minimum flanked by high barrier on either side . Using mean first passage time formalism, we derive a general expression for the effective diffusion coefficient in the presence of TST, that quantitatively reproduces the simulation result and which reduces to Zwanzig's form only in the limit of infinite spatial correlation . We construct a continuous Gaussian field with inherent correlation to establish the effect of spatial correlation on random walk .

A very high stellar mass can be ruled out a the cause of the fast evolution . Instead the evolution time scale is reproduced in stellar model by making the assumption that the efficiency for element mixing in the He flash convection zone during the very late thermal pulse is smaller than predicted by the mixing length theory . As a result the main energy generation from fast proton capture occurs closer to the surface and the expansion to the giant state is accelerated to a few year . Assuming a mass of V4334 Sgr of 0 .604Msun which is consistent with a distance of 4kpc a reduction of the mixing length theory mixing efficiency by a factor of 100 is required to match it evolutionary time scale . This value decrease if V4334 Sgr ha a smaller mass and accordingly a smaller distance . However, the effect doe not disappear for the smallest possible mass .

The improvement to the fit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes it reality at >99 .9% confidence we have also verified that the line is detected in the three XIS unit independently . Comparison between the data and Monte Carlo simulation show that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p < 3 .3 x 10^ 4 . Consideration of three independent line detection in Suzaku data taken at different epoch yield a probability p< 3 x 10^ 11 and thus conclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in the data . The new line and a strong component of Fe Ka emission from neutral material are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005 . Spectra from 2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energy a that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constant equivalent width against the observed continuum . The stability of the line flux and energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, a ha been suggested for similar line in other sources, but could arise from a special location in the reprocessor, such a the inner edge of the accretion disk . Alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of Fe into Cr, a discussed in a companion paper .->(94, 82)',\n",

This cognitive model is based on Multiple Time scale Recurrent Neural Networks MTRNN .With the data obtained from object manipulation task with a humanoid robot platform, the robotic agent implemented with this model can ground the primitive embodied structure of verb through training with verb noun combination sample . Moreover, we show that a functional hierarchical architecture, based on MTRNN, is able to generalise and produce novel combination of noun verb sentence . Further analysis of the learned network dynamic and representation also demonstrate how the generalisation is possible via the exploitation of this functional hierarchical recurrent network .->(32, 4)',\n",

We show that for a finite number of jump arising from the noise process, the mean squared error between the trajectory exponentially converge towards a bounded error ball across a finite interval of time under practical boundedness assumption . The convergence rate for shot noise system is the same a the exponentially stable nominal system, but with a tradeoff between the parameter of the shot noise process and the size of the error ball . The convergence rate and the error ball for the L '{e}vy noise system are shown to be nearly direct sum of the respective quantity for the shot and white noise system separately, a result which is analogous to the L '{e}vy Khintchine theorem . We demonstrate our result using several simple case study a 1D linear reference tracking system, 2D linear time varying systems, a 2D nonlinear system, and a 2D nonlinear observer design problem .->(210, 204)\",\n",

In this paper, edge theory of 2 1 dimensional topological phase protected by reflection a well a other symmetry are studied by twisting reflection symmetry, which effectively put the edge theory on an unoriented spacetime, such a the Klein bottle . A key technical step taken in this paper is the use of the so called cross cap states, which encode entirely the unoriented nature of spacetime, and can be obtained by rearranging the spacetime geometry and exchanging the role of space and time coordinate . When the system is in a non trivial SPT phase, we find that the corresponding cross cap state is non invariant under the action of the symmetry of the SPT phase, but acquires an anomalous phase . This anomalous phase, with a proper definition of a reference state, on which symmetry act trivially, reproduces the known classification of 2 1 dimensional bosonic and fermionic SPT phase protected by reflection symmetry, including in particular the Z_8 classification of topological crystalline superconductors protected by reflection and time reversal symmetry .->(50, 93)',\n",

Well definedness of f divergences, however, requires the distribution of the data and model to overlap completely in every time step of training . As a result, a soon a the support of distribution of data and model contain non overlapping portions, gradient based training of the corresponding model becomes hopeless . Recent advance in generative modeling are full of remedy for handling this support mismatch problem key idea include either modifying the objective function to integral probability measure IPMs that are well behaved even on disjoint probabilities, or optimizing a well behaved variational lower bound instead of the true objective . We, on the other hand, establish that a complete change of the objective function is unnecessary, and instead an augmentation of the base measure of the problematic divergence can resolve the issue . Based on this observation, we propose a generative model which leverage the class of Scaled Bregman Divergences and generalizes both f divergence and Bregman divergence .

For a 1 TeV inflaton, the late decay of these mode distort the successful prediction of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis unless M_ > 35, 13, 7, 5 and 3 TeV for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 extra dimensions, respectively . This improves the existing bound from cosmology on M_ for 4, 5 and 6 extra dimension . Even more stringent bound are derived for a heavier inflaton .->(27, 2)',\n",

This is made possible by invoking the generalized Chaplygin gas GCG model, which ha the advantage of preserving unitarity and providing a smooth transition between the inflation epoch and the radiation dominant era . The dynamic of the universe is described by the quantization in the minisuperspace of the GCG model, following the prescription proposed by Wheeler and DeWitt . Two source of contribution to the cosmic entanglement entropy are considered one from the homogeneous background where the observable and the unobservable region of the universe are entangled and the other from the inhomogeneous cosmological perturbation where different mode are entangled . We find that the homogeneous contribution grows exponentially at the very beginning of the inflation, but decrease during the radiation dominant era . Conversely, that from the cosmological perturbation is found to decrease at first and then increase after reaching a minimum value . The net result is that the total entanglement entropy reach a minimum at an early stage of the inflation and then increase throughout most of the inflation and the entire radiation dominant era .->(120, 119)',\n",

In the first part of this work we explain how the process of structure formation in KFT can be separated into three processes, particle diffusion, the accumulation of structure due to initial momentum correlation and interaction relative to the inertial motion of particle . We study these process by examining the time derivative of the non linear density power spectrum in the Born approximation . We observe that diffusion and accumulation are delicately balanced because of the Gaussian form of the initial conditions, and that the net diffusion, resulting from adding these two counteracting contributions, approach the contribution from the interaction in amplitude over time . This hint at a kinematic relation between diffusion and interaction in KFT . Indeed, in the second part, we show that the response of the system to arbitrary gradient force is directly related to the evolution of particle diffusion in the form of kinematic fluctuation dissipation relation FDRs . This result is independent of the interaction potential . We show that this relationship root in a time reversal symmetry of the underlying generating functional . Furthermore, our study demonstrate how FDRs originating from purely kinematic argument can be used in theory far from equilibrium .->(242, 239)',\n",

Electroencephalogram EEG is suitable to detect micro sleep because EEG wa associated with consciousness and sleep . Deep learning showed great performance in recognizing brain states, but sufficient data should be needed . However, collecting micro sleep data during driving is inefficient and ha a high risk of obtaining poor data quality due to noisy driving situation . Night sleep data at home is easier to collect than micro sleep data during driving . Therefore, we proposed a deep learning approach using night sleep EEG to improve the performance of micro sleep detection . We pre trained the U Net to classify the 5 class sleep stage using night sleep EEG and used the sleep stage estimated by the U Net to detect micro sleep during driving . This improved micro sleep detection performance by about 30 % compared to the traditional approach . Our approach wa based on the hypothesis that micro sleep corresponds to the early stage of non rapid eye movement NREM sleep . We analyzed EEG distribution during night sleep and micro sleep and found that micro sleep ha a similar distribution to NREM sleep . Our result provide the possibility of similarity between micro sleep and the early stage of NREM sleep and help prevent micro sleep during driving .->(127, 115)\",\n",

The aim of this study is to provide observational constraint on theoretical prediction that the wind of M type AGB object can be driven by photon scattering on iron free silicate grain located in the close environment about 2 to 3 stellar radius of the star . We interpreted spectro interferometric data, first using wavelength dependent geometric model . We then used a self consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a time dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particle to reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurement of RT Vir . Since the hydrodynamic computation need stellar parameter a input, a considerable effort wa first made to determine these parameter . MIDI differential phase reveal the presence of an asymmetry in the stellar vicinity . Results from the geometrical modeling give u clue to the presence of aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment < 5 stellar radius . Comparison between spectro interferometric data and a self consistent dust driven wind model reveals that silicate dust ha to be present in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radius to reproduce the 59 and 63 m baseline visibility measurement around 9 .8 micron . This give additional observational evidence in favor of wind driven by photon scattering on iron free silicate grain located in the close vicinity of an M type star .

The agreement of the dynamic model atmosphere with interferometric measurement in the 8 10 micron spectral region give additional observational evidence that the wind of M type star can be driven by photon scattering on iron free silicate grain .

Adding a static thermal bias, allows one to compute the heat current thermal load characteristic which includes the ratchet effect of negative thermal bias with positive valued heat flow against the thermal bias, up to the thermal stop load .

Potential surface density pair consist of a homogeneous'' pair a closed form expression corresponding to a uniform disk, and a residual'' pair . This residual component is converted into an infinite series of integral over the radial extent of the disk . For a certain class of surface density distribution like power law of the radius, this series is fully analytical . The extraction of the homogeneous pair is equivalent to a convergence acceleration technique, in a matematical sense . In the case of power law distributions, the convergence rate of the residual series is shown to be cubic inside the source . As a consequence, very accurate potential value are obtained by low order truncation of the series . At zero order, relative error on potential value do not exceed a few percent typically, and scale with the order N of truncation a 1 N 3 . This method is superior to the classical multipole expansion whose very slow convergence is often critical for most practical application .->(95, 101)\",\n",

Accompanying theoretical analysis prof that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to deterministically recover all signal ${ bf x}$ satisfying a natural flatness i .e, non sparsity condition for a particular choice of deterministic correlation based measurement . A randomized version of these same measurement is then shown to provide nonuniform probabilistic recovery guarantee for arbitrary signal ${ bf x} in mathbb{C}^d$ . Numerical experiment demonstrate the method's speed, accuracy, and robustness in practice all code is made publicly available . Finally, we conclude by developing an extension of the proposed method to the sparse phase retrieval problem specifically, we demonstrate a sublinear time compressive phase retrieval algorithm which is guaranteed to recover a given $s$ sparse vector ${ bf x} in mathbb{C}^d$ with high probability in just $ mathcal{O} s log^5 s cdot log d $ time using only $ mathcal{O} s log^4 s cdot log d $ magnitude measurement .

Restricting a global function to a spatial subdomain whether by necessity or by design is a windowing operation, and an equation like a convolution in the spectral domain relates the expected value of the windowed power spectrum to the underlying global power spectrum and the known power spectrum of the localization window . The best window for the purpose of localized spectral analysis have their energy concentrated in the region of interest while possessing the smallest effective bandwidth a possible . Solving an optimization problem in the sense of Slepian 1960 yield a family of orthogonal window of diminishing spatiospectral localization, the best concentrated of which we propose to use to form a weighted multitaper spectrum estimate in the sense of Thomson 1982 . Such an estimate is both more representative of the target region and reduces the estimation variance when compared to estimate formed by any single bandlimited window .

These object share in common a high resemblance between the optical and infrared lightcurves, such that the mechanism responsible to produce them is the same . The aim of this paper is to explain both lightcurves simultaneously with only one mechanism . Methods We have modeled the infrared emission a coming from a warp composed of an optically thick wall and an optically thick asymmetric disk beyond this location . We have modeled the optical emission mainly by partial stellar occultation by the warp . Results The magnitude amplitude of the CoRoT and Spitzer observation for all the object can be described with the emission coming from the system component . The difference between them is the value of the disk flux compared with the wall flux and the azimuthal variation of the former . This result point out the importance of the hydrodynamical interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the disk . Conclusions CoRoT and Spitzer lightcurves for the stellar system Mon 660, Mon 811, Mon 1140 and Mon 1308 can be simultaneously explained using the emission coming from an asymmetric disk and emission with stellar occultation by an optically thick wall .->(11, 54)',\n",

We put forward a simple geometric criterion that reveals the non classicality of the membership weight structure and use experimentally measured membership weight estimated by subject in experiment to illustrate our geometrical criterion .

For each galaxy, the MaNGA pipeline produce relatively large data file to preserve the spatial correlation of the spectrum and measurements, but this come at the expense of storing the data set in a coarsely chunked manner . The coarse chunking and total volume of the data make it time consuming to download and curate locally stored data .

By reformulating the complex operation using octave convolutions, our model show a strong ability to capture richer representation of MR images, while at the same time greatly reducing the spatial redundancy .

Following this formalism, we have measured the dark matter equation of state for first time using improved technique . We have found that the value of the equation of state parameter is consistent with pressureless dark matter within the error . Nevertheless, the measured value is lower than expected because typically the mass determined with lensing are larger than those obtained through kinematic method . We have tested our technique using simulation and we have also analyzed possible source of error that could invalidate or mimic our result .

Taking into account that both scientific realism and constructivism represent, on the basis of a rather broad spectrum, prevalent philosophical current in the domain of science education, the compatibility of their essential commitment is examined against the conceptual structure of quantum theory . It is argued in this respect that the object of science do not simply constitute 'personal constructions' of the human mind for interpreting nature, a individualist constructivist consider, neither do they form product of a 'social construction', a sociological constructivist assume on the contrary, they reflect objective structural aspect of the physical world . A realist interpretation of quantum mechanics, we suggest, is not only possible but also necessary for revealing the inner meaning of the theory's scientific content . It is pointed out, however, that a viable realist interpretation of quantum theory requires the abandonment or radical revision of the classical conception of physical reality and it traditional metaphysical presupposition . To this end, we put forward an alternative to traditional realism interpretative scheme, that is in harmony with the finding of present day quantum theory, and which, if adequately introduced into the instructional process of contemporary physics, is expected to promote the conceptual reconstruction of learner towards an appropriate view of nature .->(12, 9)\",\n",

The resulting disk structure is gyrentropic, with convection proceeding along common surface of constant angular momentum, Bernoulli function and entropy, called gyrentropes . We present a family of two dimensional, self similar model which describes the time averaged disk structure . We then suppose that there is a self similar, Newtonian torque and that the Prandtl number is large . This torque drive inflow and meridional circulation and the resulting flow is computed . Convective transport will become ineffectual near the disk surface . It is conjectured that this will lead to a large increase of entropy across a thermal front which we identify a the effective disk surface and the base of an outflow . The conservation of mass, momentum and energy across this thermal front permit a matching of the disk model to self similar outflow solution . We then demonstrate that self similar disk solution can be matched smoothly onto relativistic flow at small radius and thin disk at large radius .

When assuming the typical relation between UV and density in the cold neutral medium, the C column becomes a function of the metallicity alone .

For optically thick gas, most of the C column is mixed with hydrogen that is primarily molecular H2, and this C H2 gas layer account for almost all of the CO dark' molecular gas in PDRs . The C H2 column density is limited by dust shielding and is inversely proportional to the metallicity down to 0 .1 solar .

At redshift 1<z<3 in massive disc galaxy the C H2 gas represents a very small fraction of the total molecular gas <0 .16 .

At closer distance towards galactic center the strength of attractive scalar fifth force becomes much stronger than gravity and is balanced by the Fermi pressure of dark matter cloud, thus an equilibrium static configuration of dark matter halo is obtained . Like the case of soliton star or fermion Q star, the stability of the dark matter halo is obtained a the scalar achieves a static profile and reach an asymptotic value away from the galactic center . For simple scalar dark matter interaction and quadratic scalar self interaction potential, we show that dark matter behaves exactly like cold dark matter CDM beyond few $ rm{kpc}$ away from galactic center but at closer distance it becomes lighter and fermi pressure cannot be ignored anymore . Using Thomas Fermi approximation, we numerically solve the radial static profile of the scalar field, fermion mass and dark matter energy density a a function of distance .

When particle are separated by distance within the viscous subrange, the competition between quiet regular region and multi valued caustic lead to a quasi bi fractal behavior of the particle velocity structure functions, with high order moment bringing the statistical signature of caustic . Contrastingly, for particle separated by inertial range distances, the velocity difference statistic is characterized in term of a local H {o}lder exponent, which is a function of the scale dependent particle Stokes number only . Results are supported by high resolution direct numerical simulation . It is argued that these finding might have implication in the early stage of rain droplet formation in warm cloud .->(53, 49)',\n",

We study decay of D4D2D0 system into pair of D4D2D0 system and we show how the wall crossing formula reproduces result of Goettsche and Yoshioka on wall crossing behavior of the modulus of slope stable holomorphic bundle over holomorphic surface . Our comparison show very clearly that the modulus space of the D4D2D0 system on a rigid surface in a Calabi Yau is not the same a the modulus space of torsion free sheaves, even when worldhseet instantons are neglected . Moreover, we argue that the physical formula should make some new mathematical prediction for a future theory of the modulus of stable object in the derived category .->(126, 132)',\n",

       " ('We typically observe large scale outcome that arise from the interaction of many hidden, small scale process . Examples include age of disease onset, rate of amino acid substitutions, and composition of ecological community . The macroscopic pattern in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral process . A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased stochastic fluctuation random connection of network node amino acid substitution with no effect on fitness specie that arise or disappear from community randomly . These neutral generative model often match common pattern of nature . In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative model are so successful . I show how the classic pattern such a Poisson and Gaussian arise . Each classic pattern wa often discovered by a simple neutral generative model . The neutral pattern share a special characteristic they describe the pattern of nature that follow from simple constraint on information . For example, any aggregation of process that preserve information only about the mean and variance attracts to the Gaussian pattern any aggregation that preserve information only about the mean attracts to the exponential pattern any aggregation that preserve information only about the geometric mean attracts to the power law pattern . I present an informational framework of the common pattern of nature based on the method of maximum entropy . This framework show that each neutral generative model is a special case that help to discover a particular set of informational constraint those informational constraint define a much wider domain of non neutral generative process that attract to the same neutral pattern .->(60, 111)',\n",

       " ('The presented previously indirect optimization method IOM developed within biochemical system theory BST provides a versatile and mathematically tractable optimization strategy for biochemical system . However, due to the local approximation nature of the BST formalism, the iterative version of this technique possibly doe not yield the true optimum solution . In this work, an algorithm is proposed to obtain the correct and consistent optimum steady state operating point of biochemical system . The existing linear optimization problem of the direct IOM approach is modified by adding an equality constraint of describing the consistency of solution between the S system and the original model . Lagrangian analysis is employed to derive the first order necessary optimality condition for the above modified optimization problem . This lead to a procedure that may be regarded a a modified iterative IOM approach in which the optimization objective function includes an extra linear term . The extra term contains a comparison of metabolite concentration derivative with respect to the enzyme activity between the S system and the original model and ensures that the new algorithm is still carried out within linear programming technique . The presented framework is applied to several biochemical system and shown to the tractability and effectiveness of the method . The simulation is also studied to investigate the convergence property of the algorithm and to give a performance comparison of standard and modified iterative IOM approach .->(70, 58)',\n",
